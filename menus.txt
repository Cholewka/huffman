Huffman coding manual

The program de facto does two tasks. With Huffman coding algorithm it
compresses and decompresses files that are provided.

In main menu, besides manual, are two options to chose from. Options may
be chosen in every moment when the program asks for them, for example now.

Available options to choose:

(1) - compress file. The program will ask for path to the file that you want
to compress and the path to the output file, that will receive compressed text.

(2) - decompress file. The program will ask for path to the file that you want
to decompress and the path to the output file, that will receive decompressed text.

Enter 0 to get back into the main menu.
